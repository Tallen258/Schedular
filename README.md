# Google Calendar AI Assistant Proposal

I want to create a calendar with an AI assistant that will help me plan and reschedule my week. It will have the ability to find free time, identify good schedules and make changes I approve of.  
It will have room to grow with the ability to compare schedules versus others peoples schedules and plan best meeting time between the two.
